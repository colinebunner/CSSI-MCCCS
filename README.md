# MCCCS-PyWrapper
A set of Python tools for organizing and running Monte Carlo simulations with the MCCCS-MN code.
The goal is simply to provide a Python library for manipulating the FORTRAN input files and handle
the output files in a consistent manner that makes workflow development (particularly with the 
signac/signac-flow libaries) easy.
